# SOC-Automation-Project

Phase 1:

This project was an introduction to Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows and automation, where I explored the integration of industry tools like TheHive, Wazuh, Shuffle Automation, and Docker. The primary goal was to automate threat detection and streamline alerting processes to ensure timely and efficient response by SOC analysts. I configured Wazuh for threat detection and integrated it with TheHive to enable centralized case management. Using Shuffle Automation, I built workflows to automatically trigger and forward alerts to SOC analysts when specific threats were detected.


Throughout the project, I developed strong problem-solving skills by overcoming challenges, such as resolving webhook URL conflicts between Shuffle and Wazuh. I demonstrated adaptability and persistence while debugging configurations and fine-tuning integrations. Additionally, the experience honed my attention to detail and ability to manage complex workflows in a fast-paced environment. By successfully completing this project, I gained hands-on experience with SOC tools and developed a deeper understanding of cybersecurity automation, preparing me for future projects in the field.
